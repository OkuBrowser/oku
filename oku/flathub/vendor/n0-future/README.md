# [n0-future](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=enGlMJZOi2I&t=147s)

[number 0]'s way of doing async rust.

This crate is supposed to fulfill two purposes:
1. Make it easier to grab one library that re-exposes some sane future/stream combinators that don't use too much unsafe code and seem safe without requiring you to install lots of small libraries.
2. Make it easier to write async code that is Wasm-compatible.

## About safer `future`-related code

We re-expose `futures-lite`, `futures-buffered` and `futures-util` (but mostly for `Sink` and its combinators).
If you're wondering why we're not re-exposing/using X Y or Z, please first read our article about some of our challenges with async rust: https://www.iroh.computer/blog/async-rust-challenges-in-iroh

## About easier Wasm-compatible code

Writing code that works in the `wasm*-*-unknown` targets is not easy:
- `std::time::Instant::now()` panics on use
- You can't spawn threads
- If you use `wasm-bindgen` (practically your only option), structs like `JsValue` are `!Send`.

We aim to solve these issues by providing similar-looking APIs that are easy to `#[cfg(...)]` between Wasm and non-wasm targets, ideally not requiring any cfg at all, but instead the cfg-ing is limited to happen inside this library only.

We do this in a couple of ways:
- `n0_future::time` re-exports `tokio::time::Instant` and friends natively, but `web_time::Instant` and friends in Wasm.
- `n0_future::task` re-exports `tokio` with its `spawn`, `JoinHandle`, `JoinSet`, `Sleep`, `Timeout`, `Interval`, etc. utilities, but in Wasm re-exports a very similar API that's based on `wasm-bindgen-futures`.
- Generally, re-exports natively are `Send`, while re-exports in browsers are `!Send`. There's quickly a need for utilities such as `n0_future::boxed` which re-exports `Box<dyn Future + Send>` natively, but just `Box<dyn Future>` in Wasm (and the same for `Stream`).

## Scope

It's entirely possible that we'll expand the scope of this library, that currently is mostly a re-exports crate to a crate that provides our own flavor of async APIs that we deem are safer to use, we write about some of these ideas in this issue: https://github.com/n0-computer/iroh/issues/2979

## Feature flags

* `serde`: Enables serde support for the [`time::SystemTime`] type when building for WebAssembly.

## Note to Maintainers: Creating a release

- Make sure to have `git-cliff`, `cargo-release` and `cargo-semver-checks` installed.
- Figure out whether this release is major/minor/patch by running `cargo semver-checks check-release --release-type=major/minor/patch` and see which one fits
- Use `git-cliff` to generate the changelog
- Bump the version by major/minor/patch in `Cargo.toml` and create a release prep PR.
- Run `cargo release` to check if the release would go through well.
- Run `cargo release --execute` to run the release
