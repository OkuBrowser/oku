## 0.2.1 (2026-08-05)
### Fixed
- Warning on softfloat AArch64 targets by not enabling `aarch64_sha3` backend on them ([#126])

## 0.2.0 (2026-03-16)
### Added
- `keccak_backend` configuration parameter with `aarch64_sha3`, `simd128`,
  `simd256`, `simd512`, and `soft` values ([#105], [#106], [#113])
- `Keccak` struct with a closure-based API for a more efficient access to
  supported backends ([#113])

  enabled by default on AArch64 targets behind target feature auto-detection) ([#112])

### Removed
- `asm`, `simd`, and `no_unroll` crate features in favor of `keccak_backend`
  and `keccak_backend_soft` configuration parameters ([#105], [#106], [#113])
