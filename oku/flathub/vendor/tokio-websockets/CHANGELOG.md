## [0.13.1] - 2025-12-28

### Added

- The new `WebSocketStream::into_inner` method discards the WebSocket stream and provides you with the raw underlying I/O
- It is now possible to add custom headers to the built-in server's Switching Protocols response via `ServerBuilder::add_header`

### Fixed

- Compilation with the `nightly` feature enabled on s390x now works with the latest nightlies again
- Fixed a case of UB in the ARM NEON intrinsic code uncovered by Miri

### Other

- CI now test builds all feature combinations on architectures supported by the SIMD code (aarch64, loongarch64, ppc64le, s390x, x86_64)
- Further, on aarch64, ppc64le, s390x and x86_64 we now also run the tests with Miri

## [0.13.0] - 2025-10-07

### Added

- With the `nightly` feature enabled and no random number generator enabled, `std::random` will now be used

### Changed

- **[breaking]** The default `rustls` crypto provider is now installed implicitly, which in turn results in `TlsConnector::now` now panicking instead of returning the now-removed `NoCryptoProviderConfigured` error variant
- **[breaking]** The MSRV is now 1.89, which means AVX512 support is now available without the `nightly` feature

## [0.12.3] - 2025-09-28

### Fixed

- The docs build should be fixed by this release

## [0.12.2] - 2025-09-28

### Fixed

- The minimum version requirement for `fastrand` was corrected to `2.2.0` to match reality

## [0.12.1] - 2025-08-21

### Fixed

- Fixed an out-of-bounds access when sending a large number of messages at once

## [0.12.0] - 2025-07-11

### Added

- With the `nightly` feature enabled, SIMD-accelerated masking is now supported on s390x and loongarch64

### Changed

- `webpki-roots` was upgraded to 1.x
- `rustls-platform-verifier` was upgraded to 0.6
- Multiple pending messages are now written in a single vectored write, improving performance when using `SinkExt::feed`
- **[breaking]** The `rustls`-related features now require [configuring a global crypto provider for rustls](https://docs.rs/rustls/latest/rustls/crypto/struct.CryptoProvider.html#method.install_default)

### Fixed

- After writing the WebSocket upgrade request, the connection was not flushed, so in some cases with buffering, the connection would be stuck trying to read an upgrade response

### Removed

- **[breaking]** The `simd` feature flag was removed - it had no effect since 0.11.1, SIMD support is now detected at runtime

## [0.11.4] - 2025-04-18

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where `poll_next` would not attempt to flush to stream when there is data to be sent. This is achieved by storing and then reusing the writer task's waker in `poll_next`.

## [0.11.3] - 2025-02-17

### Fixed

- In cases where the underlying I/O was failed but data remained to be sent, a call to `poll_close` the WebSocket stream would block indefinitely, this is now properly handled by returning `None` from `poll_next` after I/O errors

## [0.11.2] - 2025-02-09

### Changed

- `rand` was updated to 0.9
- Reduced the amount of unsafe code

### Fixed

- The `Host` header no longer unconditionally includes a port anymore, which is more in line with the RFC and fixes interacting with some webservers

## [0.11.1] - 2025-01-26

### Changed

- The size of several structs has been slightly decreased, reducing memory usage
- The SIMD algorithms have been improved and support for them is now detected at runtime. The `simd` feature flag is deprecated
- `getrandom` was updated to 0.3

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where a pending `poll_flush` call by a writer would stall infinitely if `poll_next` was called at the same time (see [#92](https://github.com/Gelbpunkt/tokio-websockets/issues/92))

## [0.11.0] - 2025-01-03

### Added

- The SIMD masking code now supports AltiVec on PowerPC targets (nightly only)
- `WebSocketStream::{get_ref, get_mut}` allow access to the underlying I/O
- `client::DISALLOWED_HEADERS` is a list of headers that may not be added via `ClientBuilder::add_header`
- `CloseCode::is_reserved` returns whether the close code is reserved (i.e. may not be sent over the wire)

### Changed

- **[breaking]** `ServerBuilder::accept` now returns the client's HTTP request alongside the websocket stream in a tuple
- **[breaking]** `ClientBuilder::add_header` now returns a `Result` and errors when adding a disallowed header
- **[breaking]** `Message::close` will now panic when the close code is reserved or the reason exceeds 123 bytes
- **[breaking]** `Message::{ping, pong}` will now panic when the payload exceeds 125 bytes
- `rustls-platform-verifier` was updated to 0.5
- The SIMD masking code is now more efficient

### Fixed

- Fixed compilation with SIMD on 32-bit x86 targets
- 32-bit ARM NEON is unstable in rustc and now correctly gated behind the `nightly` feature

## [0.10.1] - 2024-09-13

### Added

- The new `rustls-bring-your-own-connector` feature allows for creating a `Connector::Rustls` instance without pulling in any other certificate roots
- The sink flush threshold is now configurable via `Config::flush_threshold`

### Changed

- `Config::frame_size` now panics when the frame size is set to 0
- Reduced the number of allocations which was caused by a misunderstanding of `BytesMut::reserve` internals, improving throughput by up to 30%
- The number of pending bytes to be written is no longer calculated in a potentially expensive loop in `poll_ready`, but rather tracked as messages are queued

### Fixed

- Fixed a case of possible UB in the UTF-8 validator discovered by the new fuzzer ([@finnbear](https://github.com/finnbear))
- The UTF-8 validator now uses the faster validation for partial codepoints as intended, earlier this was only the case if the number of bytes available matched the number expected

## [0.10.0] - 2024-09-04

### Added

- `Error::NoNativeRootCertificatesFound` was added and is returned in `TlsConnector::new` if no native root certificates were found and the rustls-webpki-roots feature is not enabled

### Changed

- If no crypto provider is specified via crate features, tokio-websockets will now try to use the installed default provider in rustls
- `TlsConnector::new` is now always available
- **[breaking]** `Error::NoTlsConnectorConfigured` was removed and replaced by `Error::NoCryptoProviderConfigured`
- `rustls-native-certs` was updated to 0.8

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where connecting to an IPv6 address would fail
- Specify the actual minimum version required of rustls-platform-verifier

## [0.9.0] - 2024-08-05

### Added

- `Payload` now implements `From<Vec<u8>>`
- `Payload` now also implements `Into<BytesMut>`, which is a cheap conversion unless multiple references to the backing buffer exist

### Changed

- **[breaking]** The MSRV is now 1.79, allowing use of `split_at_mut_unchecked` to make some unsafe code less error prone
- **[breaking]** The minimum required version of bytes is now 1.7
- **[breaking]** The `Resolver` trait now uses async fn syntax
- The `From<String>` implementation on `Payload` now uses `BytesMut` internally, improving performance in some cases
- The `From<Bytes>` implementation on `Payload` now uses `BytesMut` internally if cheaply possible, improving performance in some cases

## [0.8.3] - 2024-05-24

### Fixed

- Fixed an unsafe precondition violation triggered upon receiving close messages with empty reason

## [0.8.2] - 2024-04-16

### Fixed

- Yet another docs.rs build fix

## [0.8.1] - 2024-04-16

### Added

- Added support for `rustls-platform-verifier` via a feature with the same name

### Fixed

- Fixed the docs.rs build

## [0.8.0] - 2024-04-15

### Added

- Support for `aws_lc_rs` as a SHA1 and crypto provider was added via the `aws_lc_rs` feature, optionally also FIPS-compliant via the `fips` feature
- The new `rustls-tls12` feature will enable TLS1.2 support in rustls

### Changed

- **[breaking]** The rustls dependency was updated to 0.23 and tokio-rustls to 0.26
- **[breaking]** The minimum required version of tokio-util is now 0.7.3
- A bunch of leftover unused `Encoder` implementations and the associated write buffers were removed
- The `client` feature no longer depends on `tokio/rt`

### Fixed

- The `nightly` feature now enables the `stdarch_x86_avx512` nightly feature only on x86_64 instead of all architectures
- The documentation for `Config::frame_size` was ambiguous about whether it affected the payload size or the entire frame size, this has been clarified to be the payload size

### Removed

- The `http-integration` feature and associated `upgrade_request` method were removed, it offered little to no value over manually crafting a request and bloated the dev-dependency stack unnecessarily

## [0.7.0] - 2024-02-27

### Changed

- **[breaking]** The future returned from `Resolver::resolve` is now required to be `Send`. This restores backwards compatibility with 0.5.x

## [0.6.0] - 2024-02-27

### Added

- `Payload` now implements `From<&'static [u8]>` and `From<&'static str>`
- The `ClientBuilder` now allows specifying a DNS resolver that implements the `Resolver` trait via `ClientBuilder::resolver`, stored as a generic on the builder. It defaults to `resolver::Gai`, which matches behavior on previous versions

### Changed

- **[breaking]** `ClientBuilder::connect` now returns an `Error::UnsupportedScheme` if the URI does not set the scheme to `ws` or `wss`
- **[breaking]** `ClientBuilder::connect` will no longer unconditionally use the specified custom connector, instead it will always use a plain connector for the `ws` scheme
- **[breaking]** The `nightly` feature now uses the new `stdsimd` feature instead of `stdarch_x86_avx512`, which was removed in recent nightly compiler versions

### Fixed

- The `Debug` implementation of `Connector` now prints the correct name of the `Rustls` variant
- The header buffer size in the built-in server was increased to 64, which allows clients sending larger amounts of headers to connect
- Fixed a case of UB when a message was constructed via `Message::text` with invalid UTF-8 and then converted to a `&str` via `Message::as_text`. This will now cause a panic

## [0.5.1] - 2023-12-29

### Changed

- `Message::text` now takes `Into<Payload>` instead of `String`, which now implements `Into<Payload>`

## [0.5.0] - 2023-12-11

### Dependencies

- Updated `http` to 1.0 and `rustls`-related dependencies to those compatible with `rustls` 0.22
- **[breaking]** `ring` is now an optional dependency with `rustls` and different crypto providers can be used
- Optimized `simdutf8` feature flags for aarch64

### Changed

- **[breaking]** `upgrade_request` no longer uses an explicit body type, now it only requires the body to implement `Default`
- **[breaking]** `WebsocketStream` has been renamed to `WebSocketStream`
- **[breaking]** `Message` payloads are now exposed as `Payload` and it is possible to create messages from `Bytes`-backed payloads
- Removed a few excess allocations in hot paths

### Fixed

- Fixed issues with the close sequence handling

## [0.4.1] - 2023-11-23

### Fixed

- Fixed invalid opcode errors when intermediate control frames were received

## [0.4.0] - 2023-09-10

### Dependencies

- Update `webpki` to 0.24, `webpki-roots` to 0.25 and `rust-webpki` to 0.101

### Added

- Added support for NEON-accelerated frame (un)masking
- Added support for AVX512-accelerated frame (un)masking, gated behind the `nightly` feature flag and requires a nightly compiler
- Limits for payload length can be applied via `{ClientBuilder, ServerBuilder}::limits` to protect against malicious peers
- The websocket stream can now be configured via `{ClientBuilder, ServerBuilder}::config`. This currently only supports changing the frame payload size that outgoing messages are chunked into

### Changed

- The crate now specifies and validates a MSRV of Rust 1.64
- The library now validates UTF-8 in partial continuation frames to a text message
- Several types now implement `Debug`
- The performance of the decoder has been improved
- The encoder is now usually zero-copy and operates in-place when possible
- Reduced the amount of calls to `fastrand`
- `upgrade::Error` is now publicly accessible and can thus be matched on
- **[breaking]** `ClientBuilder` methods which perform a handshake now return a tuple of `(WebsocketStream, Response)` to retrieve e.g. response headers
- **[breaking]** `WebsocketStream` is now fully cancellation safe and implements `Stream`, therefore using `WebsocketStream::next` now requires having `StreamExt` in scope
- **[breaking]** `CloseCode` is now a wrapper around a `NonZeroU16` instead of an enum. Enum variants have been moved to associated constants. This fixes possible creation of disallowed close codes by the user
- **[breaking]** All error types are now marked as `non_exhaustive` to prevent consumer build breakage when new variants are added
- **[breaking]** Emptied default features

### Removed

- **[breaking]** `{ClientBuilder, ServerBuilder}::fail_fast_on_invalid_utf8` has been removed and is now always enabled because our implementation for streaming UTF-8 validation is already efficient enough, benchmarks show no gains anymore
- **[breaking]** Some error variants have been removed and coalesced into other variants (mostly into `InvalidOpcode`). `ConnectionClosed` has been entirely removed in favor of returning `None` from `poll_next` because it is more idiomatic
- **[breaking]** `WebsocketStream::close` has been removed. The `SinkExt::close` implementation will send a default close message and properly shut down the sink. Custom close messages can be sent via `SinkExt::send` followed by `SinkExt::close`
- The `futures-util` dependency has been removed

### Fixed

- A few inconsistencies with the websocket RFC have been fixed
