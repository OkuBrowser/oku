/// Protocol state and logic for a single QUIC connection
///
/// Objects of this type receive [`ConnectionEvent`]s and emit [`EndpointEvent`]s and application
/// [`Event`]s to make progress. To handle timeouts, a `Connection` returns timer updates and
/// expects timeouts through various methods. A number of simple getter methods are exposed
/// to allow callers to inspect some of the connection state.
///
/// `Connection` has roughly 4 types of methods:
///
/// - A. Simple getters, taking `&self`
/// - B. Handlers for incoming events from the network or system, named `handle_*`.
/// - C. State machine mutators, for incoming commands from the application. For convenience we
///   refer to this as "performing I/O" below, however as per the design of this library none of the
///   functions actually perform system-level I/O. For example, [`read`](RecvStream::read) and
///   [`write`](SendStream::write), but also things like [`reset`](SendStream::reset).
/// - D. Polling functions for outgoing events or actions for the caller to take, named `poll_*`.
///
/// The simplest way to use this API correctly is to call (B) and (C) whenever
/// appropriate, then after each of those calls, as soon as feasible call all
/// polling methods (D) and deal with their outputs appropriately, e.g. by
/// passing it to the application or by making a system-level I/O call. You
/// should call the polling functions in this order:
///
/// 1. [`poll_transmit`](Self::poll_transmit)
/// 2. [`poll_timeout`](Self::poll_timeout)
/// 3. [`poll_endpoint_events`](Self::poll_endpoint_events)
/// 4. [`poll`](Self::poll)
///
/// Currently the only actual dependency is from (2) to (1), however additional
/// dependencies may be added in future, so the above order is recommended.
///
/// (A) may be called whenever desired.
///
/// Care should be made to ensure that the input events represent monotonically
/// increasing time. Specifically, calling [`handle_timeout`](Self::handle_timeout)
/// with events of the same [`Instant`] may be interleaved in any order with a
/// call to [`handle_event`](Self::handle_event) at that same instant; however
/// events or timeouts with different instants must not be interleaved.
