General purpose implementation of the [QUIC transport
protocol](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9000.html) in pure
Rust. Noq is built as an async-friendly API in the `noq` crate on top
of a sans-io protocol library in `noq-proto`.

Noq started out as a fork of the excellent
[Quinn](https://github.com/quinn-rs/quinn) project. The main focus of
development has been towards adding support for more QUIC (draft)
extensions:

- [QUIC Multipath](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-quic-multipath/)
- [QUIC Address Discovery](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-quic-address-discovery/) (QAD)
- [Using QUIC to traverse Nat's](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-seemann-quic-nat-traversal/) (QNT)

## Features

- Easy to use futures-based async API.
- Client and server server functionality.
- 0-RTT and 0.5-RTT data support.
- Ordered and unordered stream reads.
- Custom and zero-length connection identifiers.
- Fully pluggable crypto API with a [Rustls] implementation using
  [ring] or [aws-lc-rs] provided by default for convenience.
- Broad platform support, including Linux, Windows, macOS, android,
  iOS and wasm.

## Standards

The noq library aims to be correct implementation of various QUIC
standards:

- Supports the core QUIC specifications:
  - [RFC 8999 - Version-Independent Properties of QUIC].
  - [RFC 9000 - QUIC: A UDP-Based Multiplexed and Secure Transport].
  - [RFC 9001 - Using TLS to Secure QUIC].
  - [RFC 9002 - QUIC Loss Detection and Congestion Control].
- The standardised QUIC extensions:
  - [RFC 9221 - An Unreliable Datagram Extension to QUIC].
  - [RFC 9287 - Greasing the QUIC Bit].
  - [RFC 9368 - Compatible Version Negotiation for QUIC].
- Draft extensions:
  - [qlog: Structured Logging for Network Protocols].
  - [QUIC Multipath].
    - With experimental qlog support.
  - [QUIC Address Discovery] (QAD).
  - [Using QUIC to traverse NATs] (QNT).

## Getting started

Examples at https://github.com/n0-computer/noq/blob/main/noq/examples

```
$ cargo run --example server ./
$ cargo run --example client https://localhost:4433/Cargo.toml
```

This launches an HTTP 0.9 server over the QUIC transport on the
loopback address serving the current working directory, with the
client fetching ./Cargo.toml. By default, the server generates a
self-signed certificate and stores it to disk, where the client will
automatically find and trust it.
