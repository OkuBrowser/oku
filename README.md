# [Oku](https://okubrowser.github.io)
## Browse & express yourself

Oku is a browser that offers a space that exists parallel to the web, where sites are shared between peers and found through social bookmarking.\
While you may still browse traditional sites, Oku enables you to create, share, and find content without being beholden to centralised corporate interests.\
Unleash your creativity and join a network of users supporting an independent effort to reintroduce control, privacy, & free expression online.
