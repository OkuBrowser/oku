#### Make & share your own sites.

- Oku lets you create *replicas*, virtual drives that you can share online.
- Replicas can contain anything, including photos, videos, or documents.
- You can put a site in a replica and share it with the world.

#### *Your* data on *your* machine.

- Replicas are sent with *tickets*.
- A *read-only ticket* can be used to view, but not edit, your replica.
- A *read & write ticket* can be used to view or edit your replica.
- Sites can keep your data with you in a replica by asking for a read & write ticket.

#### Build your own space on the Internet, independent from social media platforms.

- Replicas can be viewed by their ID.
- Every time you visit a new replica, your browser saves its ID.
- When you update a replica, those with its ID will see the newest version.
