# Reporting Security Issues

The Oku team and community take security issues seriously. Your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings are appreciated, and every effort will be made to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ['Report a Vulnerability'](https://github.com/OkuBrowser/oku/security/advisories/new) tab.

The Oku team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security issues in third-party dependencies to the maintainers of the dependency.
