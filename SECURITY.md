## Reporting security problems to Oku

**DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE** to report a security problem. Instead, please
send an email to [mailto:limesayahi@gmail.com](limesayahi@gmail.com)

## Incident Response Process

In case an incident is discovered or reported, I will follow the following
process to contain, respond and remediate:

### 1. Containment

The first step is to find out the root cause, nature and scope of the incident.

- Is the incident outside of my direct control? If yes, first priority is to contain it.
- Find out knows about the incident and who is affected.
- Find out what data was potentially exposed.

### 2. Response

After the initial assessment and containment to my best abilities, I will
document all actions taken in a response plan.

I will create a comment in [the official 'Security updates' issue](https://github.com/OkuBrowser/oku/issues/13) to inform users about
the incident and what I actions I took to contain it.

### 3. Remediation

Once the incident is confirmed to be resolved, I will summarize the lessons
learned from the incident and create a list of actions I will take to prevent
it from happening again.

## Vulnerability Management Plans

### Keep dependencies up to date

Oku has many dependencies that it relies on, and one of its dependencies may
have security vulnerabilities; if a dependency has a vulnerability, it will likely be patched, and it is important
that we incorporate those patches into Oku.

### Critical Updates And Security Notices

We learn about critical software updates and security threats from these sources
